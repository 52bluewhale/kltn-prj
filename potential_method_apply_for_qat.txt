analyze potential techniques to improve model performance when 
applying quantization aware training
------------------------------------------------------------------
method 1: Adaptive Coreset Selection (ACS)
	- propose 2 metrics based on analysis of loss and gradient of 
	quantized weights:
		+ error vector score (EVS)
		+ disagreement score (DS)
	to quantify the importance of each sample during traning
	=> guided by these 2 metrics, proposed a 
	quantization aware Adaptive Coreset Selection (ACS) method 
	to select data for current training epoch

	- QAT improve inference efficiency of target model, it is 
	computation-intensive and requires more time than full-precision training
	=> considered cost of QAT
	
	- Coreset Selection techniques aim to mitigate the high training
	cost and potential negative influence of label noise to improve
	data efficiency and robustness for full-precision training
	- Specially, Coreset Selection methods leverage the redundancy in 
	training datasets and select the most informative data to build a 
	core set for training
