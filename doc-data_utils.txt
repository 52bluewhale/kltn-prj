Data Utils Implementation for YOLOv8 QAT
----------------------------------------------------------
1. dataloader.py
	- This file handles loading data from your Vietnam 
	traffic sign dataset with:
		+ A standard dataloader for regular training
		+ A specialized QAT dataloader with 
		quantization-specific features
		+ A calibration dataloader for collecting statistics 
		to guide quantization
	- It's designed to work smoothly with your YOLOv8 model 
	structure and the dataset format you're using.
	
2. augmentation.py
	- This file contains custom augmentation techniques that 
	are quantization-friendly:
		+ QAT-specific transforms that avoid introducing 
		extreme values
		+ Modified mosaic augmentation that preserves 
		statistical properties
		+ Detail-preserving augmentations that don't destroy 
		features important for quantization
		
3. preprocessing.py
	- This file handles specialized preprocessing for quantization:
		+ Functions to normalize data in ways that reduce quantization 
		error
		+ Methods to clip outliers that could cause quantization issues
		+ Calibration approaches to ensure consistent performance
		
Key Benefits

	- Quantization Compatibility: All components are designed specifically 
	to work well with quantization, avoiding transformations that might 
	introduce problems during quantization.
	- YOLOv8 Integration: The implementation works seamlessly with YOLOv8's 
	existing data pipeline structure.
	- Performance Optimization: Includes caching mechanisms and efficient 
	processing for better training speed.
	- Specialized for Your Dataset: Configured for the Vietnam traffic sign 
	dataset with 58 classes as specified in your data.yaml file.
