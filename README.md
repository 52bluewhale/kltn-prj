Development Workflow
Follow these steps to implement QAT for YOLOv8:

Base Model Training:

Train or fine-tune YOLOv8 with the traffic sign dataset
Establish baseline performance metrics


Quantization Preparation:

Implement observers and fake quantization modules
Set up QConfig for different layers
Identify critical layers through sensitivity analysis


QAT Implementation:

Modify YOLOv8 architecture for QAT
Implement module fusion
Set up proper calibration


QAT Training:

Train the model with quantization awareness
Monitor accuracy and quantization effects
Fine-tune quantization parameters as needed


Analysis and Optimization:

Analyze layer-wise quantization errors
Optimize problematic layers with specialized quantization
Adjust parameters for critical layers


Export and Deployment:

Convert to final INT8 quantized model
Export to ONNX or other deployment formats
Benchmark performance metrics (speed, size, accuracy)



This implementation will provide you with a complete PyTorch-native quantization-aware training pipeline for YOLOv8, allowing you to efficiently deploy your traffic sign detection model on resource-constrained devices.
