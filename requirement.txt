Key Components by Category
Core PyTorch Quantization Support
The primary benefit of using PyTorch 1.13+ is improved native quantization support, which includes:

Enhanced quantization observers
Better support for fake quantization
Improved quantization-aware training modules
More robust fusion patterns

YOLOv8 Integration
Ultralytics 8.0.0+ provides the YOLOv8 implementation that you'll be modifying for QAT. The package includes:

YOLOv8 model architecture
Training and evaluation pipelines
Data loading utilities
Export functionality

Model Export and Deployment
ONNX and ONNX Runtime provide deployment capabilities for your quantized models:

ONNX: Standard format for cross-platform model deployment
ONNX Runtime: Optimized inference engine

Analysis and Visualization
Tools for analyzing quantization effects:

TensorBoard: For visualizing training metrics and model graphs
Rich: For better console output when running experiments
Memory-profiler: For tracking memory usage differences between FP32 and INT8 models

Development and Testing
Quality assurance tools:

Pytest: For unit testing quantization modules
Flake8 and Black: For maintaining code quality
Sphinx: For generating documentation
