Summary of Enhanced YOLOv8 QAT Project
I've designed a comprehensive project structure for implementing Quantization-Aware Training on YOLOv8 using only PyTorch's native quantization tools. Here's a summary of what's been provided:
1. Project Structure
The enhanced project structure follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

Core model implementation in src/models/
Quantization utilities in src/quantization/
Training pipeline in src/training/
Evaluation tools in src/evaluation/
Configuration files in configs/
Executable scripts in scripts/

2. Key Implementation Files
I've provided several key implementation files:

Main Entry Point (main.py): Orchestrates all operations with a unified command-line interface
QAT Configuration (configs/qat_config.yaml): Detailed configuration for quantization parameters
QAT Training Script (scripts/train_qat.py): Implements the QAT training procedure
YOLOv8 QAT Model (src/models/yolov8_qat.py): Core model class that adapts YOLOv8 for QAT

3. Implementation Approach
The implementation follows these key principles:

Pure PyTorch Native Quantization: Using only PyTorch's built-in quantization tools without third-party libraries
Modular Design: Clear separation of components for easy customization and extension
Configuration-Driven: All quantization parameters are controlled via configuration files
Comprehensive Analysis: Tools for analyzing quantization effects and performance
Progressive Implementation: Starting with a base model and progressively adding quantization

4. Development Workflow
The project is designed to support this workflow:

Initial Setup: Organize dataset and install dependencies
Base Model Training: Train a floating-point baseline model
QAT Implementation: Implement quantization modules and prepare model
QAT Training: Fine-tune with QAT
Evaluation: Compare performance with baseline
Export: Deploy the quantized model
